blurb: "A friendly walk-through of e^{iπ} + 1 = 0 with a visual explanation."

Euler’s identity is often called *“the most beautiful equation.”*  
Inline math looks like \\( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \\) and display math like

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2}\,dx \;=\; \sqrt{\pi}.
$$

Below is Grant Sanderson’s excellent video (3Blue1Brown) that builds up the
formula visually:

### Why is it beautiful?

1. It links the five fundamental constants — \\(e, i, \pi, 0, 1\\).
2. It bridges algebra, geometry and analysis in one stroke.
3. Its proof reveals deep connections between exponentials and rotations.

*Happy exploring!* 🧮
