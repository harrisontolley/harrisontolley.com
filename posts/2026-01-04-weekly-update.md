Well, the first week of 2026 is upon us and while I am happy with how things are, there is more to do. 

Being grateful and mindful was a focus of 2025 and I believe I did well and can be happy with most things, situations, and people, but I think it's a curse to always want to do more and to perpetually think you can do better. So, I am committed to writing at least a weekly update of my life that focuses on the wins from the week prior, as well as refocusing on the week ahead.

This first post I will talk about my goals for the year, or what I think they are in this present moment. I include the second clause because as I figure out who I am and what I want, which is happening very frequently (yay personal growth!) my life direction and its accompanying goals do change. 

One of my focuses this year will be on becoming self-sufficient with regards to my employment - i.e. an entrepreneur. 

I've fiddled with the idea of following my family footsteps and becoming an entrepeneur since I was young, but as of recent years figured that would be after years (perhaps even a decade) of work experience until I was 'comfortable' to branch out. But never mind, I'm not waiting for that. Maybe I will write about more of my rationale as to why my perspective has changed in a future post, but for now all I will say is that 'Skin in the Game' by Nassim Taleb was a fantastic read (at least the first 70 or so pages I've finished). 

I do like my job and what I do, and I get to work on problems/do interesting things that I wouldn't get to under my own business, but I have a strong internal urge to figure out my own way for whatever reason. My plan is to figure out what my first business will be part-time while continuing my employment with UNSW until my contract ends in June, by then I aim to go full-time with the/a business. I have an idea for what this first business will be. I am currently in the process of fleshing out the idea and validating it, so I am optimistic and excited. In a future article I will inform of the idea and why I believe it would/wouldn't work, just working through the details now. 

For those who don't know, another interest of my life is working out. This year I want to get into Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) as a personal hobby alongside my existing training regime. I have been interested in it for a while, primarily the different dimension of problem solving that I don't exercise, but never pulled the trigger just because I have been lazy and the activation energy is too high. 

A focus for my weight training is to refocus and move with intent. Forget haphazardly swinging around and scrolling Reddit. Move with intent. I'm including an additional leg day this year (Upper x3, Lower x2 per week) to hopefully get my deadlift numbers back to something reasonable and ideally pull 300kg later this year. I am unsure if my BJJ training will conflict with this, so I may update my goals later. 

For this upcoming week:
- This week I am reading 'Skin in the Game' by Nassim Taleb (currently page 69). 
- Ease back into training, back at 90% working capacity pre-holiday. 
- Finish my business plan for aforementioned company and talk with parents. 
- Sink some more hours into current Poker solver project and make some substantial progress. 

Rightio, talk soon,
Harrison.
