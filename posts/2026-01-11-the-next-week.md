Well, onto another week. 

At work this week I hope to find my project that I will be working on for the next 6 months. Ideally it will foster transferable technical skills and be interesting (obviously), but regardless I have my plan for this year, and can put up with less than ideal while I make bigger things happen - which will happen. 

I've been self studying some web dev, HTTP, cookies, web browsers and all that jazz this week and found it rather interesting. The rationale behind this is that I figure it's useful to learn things at N+1 layers of abstraction that you use it at. Understanding what's going on behind will help me understand tradeoffs and how technologies work better. I want to understand this side of computers because as I transition into my entrepreneurial career, I ultimately have to sell a product or service. This product/service will have to be all encompassing and include a frontend. No one is going to pay for a CLI (well not many people). So, I will learn frontend. Lucky me...

In my head this product/service will be with Next.js and Vercel (among other things), but I've read today on Reddit that this can be quite expensive when scaling to many users; some say this is a good problem to have. 

This past week I did okay. I sent a business plan idea to my parents and had good feedback. Unfortunately the idea relies on people other than myself (them) and unless they're excited about it (and truly excited), then I can't move too far forward by myself. 

Had a good week of training, back to near full capacity as pre-holiday. 

Poker solver is in a good enough state for me that I can remove it from my mental load. Heads Up Poker has been semi-solved with Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimisation (it just takes a really, really long time to run on single thread). 

For my next week:
- Crank some more frontend self-study hours. Revisit CSS fundamentals, layout control, Tailwind(?), investigate Next.js + Vercel stack economics at scale (and alternatives if need be). 
- Figure out my project at work and get an understanding of the landscape around the problem I'll have to solve.
- Sink more hours into Skin in the Game by Nassim Taleb (currently page 95).
- Another good week of training, no injuries, good focus. 

If I can quickly learn this fullstack development, then I will be laughing later this year. 

Well, let's have a good week,
Harrison.
