I am creating this website/blog for a few reasons. I essentially want it to function as my pseudo-diary, workbook, and archive.

As of today, the content that I think I will publish here will primarily be things that I've found interesting, I've recently been spending a lot of time thinking about, and/or actively working on (re: my github). 

The things that I've found interesting will be in my pseudo-diary articles, whereas my workbook will contain the things I am actively working on.

The 'archive' is so that later in my life, I can read through what I've done and what I was thinking about, and be transported back to the day of writing.

I'm not using this to pretend that I am smarter than I am, or be an 'intellectual', or pretend I have unique philosophical points of view - I believe I'm rather average.

The value of publishing this online is that I am forced to think about the content I will publish. 

One quote I like by Richard Feynman is that "the first is principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool." With me writing this, I know theres a chance that people could see this - anyone could - and so anything I write I have to be able to argue it or provide evidence or make sure it's true. There are things that I pretend to know, that I actually don't know, and if I were to publish these things, then it forces me to know. 

Basically, I can't just come on here and blast some crap into the ether.  

So all-in-all, this isn't really for you, it's rather me serving myself. A diary and a workbook to think aloud. Maybe you'll find this interesting, or gain some value out of it. 

If you still care about me, at the time of writing I am a 21 year old male, where my current interests are poker, game theory, reading, excercising, and programming - again, rather average. I graduated from The University of Queensland in 2024 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I currently live in Canberra, Australia. I work at The University of New South Wales as a researcher on a defence project aimed at benchmarking the ethical readiness of autonomous weapon systems. Pretty much, we're trying to make benchmarks so that killer AI robots are ethical. Maybe not an average job...? 

Maybe I'll make some videos on here, maybe not. I have a few ideas for the next posts, but beyond that, it beats me man.
